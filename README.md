I am an evolutionary biologist and bioinformatician at the University of Zurich. I am obsessed with the major paradigm shifts in the history of life on Earth, such as the development of the genetic code or the arrival of the eukaryotic cell. Could they have been realized in another way, or not have occurred at all?

I am currently investigating arguably the most important of such major changes: the evolution of multicellularity. I am developing models to better understand how clonal multicellularity can evolve adaptively.
